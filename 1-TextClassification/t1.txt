This task tests your ability to solve a real-world problem using the concepts learned in Text Classification module.
Create a benchmark analysis with different algorithms and feature extractors.

Dataset: Fetch 20 Newsgroups (same as in class work)​

Algorithms: Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees​

Feature Extractors: CountVectorizer, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec and so on​

​

Benchmark all the possible above configurations and choose the best algorithm and feature extractor amongst all configurations​ and put it in a .txt or .doc file in a tabular format.

Create a new Notebook and fill in all the necessary code cells for the benchmarking.
And  save the notebook and  submit the Ipython Notebook (. ipynb) with the following filename format:
If your name is Vejey Gandyer,  your filename (.ipynb) should be  Vejey_Task0_Text_Classification.ipynb
If your name is Vejey Gandyer,  your filename (.txt) or (.doc) should be Vejey_Task0_Text_Classification.txt or Vejey_Task0_Text_Classification.doc
All the best and have fun learning.
