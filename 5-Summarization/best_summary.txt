As my daughter was very inquisitive, she asked me “Papa, what stuff?” I said, “I need to code something for my work.” She didn’t leave.
“Neural Network is a collection (a network) of neurons whose job is to learn a new thing or a new place or a new process or a new concept.” It would be stupid on my part to start with a definition of Neural Network like how we used to teach adults in college.
I said, “Good Job!” and asked her, “Where’s the tail, baby?” She smiled and drew a tail.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
Was it a dog or a lion?
Do you know what is the difference between a lion and a dog?” She said, “Yes.” I said, “This is called Learning.
Ultimately, the neurons in your brain tell that it is a lion and not a dog.
This is what a neural network is and this is how it works in identifying things.
Tanishi: That’s it.
Me: So, for a dog, the features are face, body, legs and tail.
